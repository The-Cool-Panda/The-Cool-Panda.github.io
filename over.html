        <p>Right now, I hate Junkrat. He's a scrawny, impish explosives expert with a grenade lobbing Frag Launcher. His ultimate ability – a slow charging special attack that fills faster as you do damage and score kills – is a motorised, remote control tire bomb with a devastating area of effect. Put simply, he makes things blow up. Things like me and my team of disparate misfits, who, until Junkrat showed up, were seconds away from successfully defending the control point and winning the match.</p>

            <p>These abilities are far more straightforward to learn than in Overwatch. Omen, Jett, Brimstone, Cypher, and Viper all have some form of smokes, for example orbs of wisps (or a circle of static for Cypher). Their colours, methods of distribution, and secondary effects may differ a little, but their primary function is the same: blocking enemy vision so that you can move more freely, perhaps setting up a flank or establishing control over an area. Other shared abilities include Phoenix and Viper being able to deploy smoke in a line, while Phoenix, Brimstone, and Viper all command similar abilities to spread damage over an area, like CS:GO’s molotovs. There are some truly unique abilities to each agent – ultimates being the best example – but it’ll take you a lot less time to get a feel for the general playing field in Valorant than in Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, or even Amazon’s new contender, Crucible.
            <br><br>It's a shooter then, but with a MOBA attitude to character design. To be clear: Overwatch isn't a MOBA. Rather, it's like if Heroes of the Storm went to Team Fortress 2's house party, and left without cleaning up after itself. There's no lane-pushing, AI creeps, item shopping or levelling. Objectives are straight out of the class-based shooter playbook, with points to attack and defend, payloads to push and hills to king. But characters have abilities, each reflective of their style and personality. And those abilities have cooldown timers, each different depending on their power and utility.
