        <div class="box">
        <p>Valorant is an FPS hero shooter, and like many top tier triple-A games these days, each hero you play commands different abilities, displays different personalities, and boasts a distinct visual style – in other words, they’re true characters. Each ‘agent’ has the same choice of guns as any other – an important distinction from Overwatch – but with extra smokes, grenades, or other tactical equipment that are unique to them.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <p>These abilities are far more straightforward to learn than in Overwatch. Omen, Jett, Brimstone, Cypher, and Viper all have some form of smokes, for example orbs of wisps (or a circle of static for Cypher). Their colours, methods of distribution, and secondary effects may differ a little, but their primary function is the same: blocking enemy vision so that you can move more freely, perhaps setting up a flank or establishing control over an area. Other shared abilities include Phoenix and Viper being able to deploy smoke in a line, while Phoenix, Brimstone, and Viper all command similar abilities to spread damage over an area, like CS:GO’s molotovs. There are some truly unique abilities to each agent – ultimates being the best example – but it’ll take you a lot less time to get a feel for the general playing field in Valorant than in Rainbow Six: Siege, Overwatch, or even Amazon’s new contender, Crucible.
            <br><br>That said, it’s obvious that these agents owe Overwatch a large debt in their design. Riot really isn’t shy about admitting it when there’s a mechanic it likes: Hanzo’s sonar arrow, Mei’s ice wall, and edgy edge-lords with teleportation abilities like Reaper all find close equivalents in Valorant’s roster. I said as much in my Valorant gameplay preview, and it’s worth reiterating. I wouldn’t go as far as to say it’s a one-to-one rip-off, but very much ‘Can I copy your homework? I promise I’ll change it enough that the teacher won’t know.’ This might explain why, in Overwatch, I know and love the heroes I’m playing, while no such attachment has yet manifested itself in Valorant (although the new selection screen animations give them more personality than they had in the beta).
